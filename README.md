# mozaik-models
This repository contains models implemented in the Mozaik framework, that were published by the [Computational Systems Neuroscience Group](http://csng.mff.cuni.cz/) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University. 

To run the models present in this repository one must first install the Mozaik package and its dependencies (see [here](https://github.com/CSNG-MFF/mozaik) for more information and detailed installation instructions).
